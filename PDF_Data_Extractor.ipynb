Organization \\n\\n Systematica Alternative Markets Master Fund Limited\\n (collectively with the Subsidiary (as defined \\nbelow), the ﬁMaster Fundﬂ) was incorporated in the \\nCayman Islands on May 6, 2014 with limited \\nliability as an exempted company under the provisio\\nns of the Com\\npanies Law of the Cayman Islands \\nand is registered as a regulated mutual fund under \\nthe Mutual Funds Law of the Cayman Islands on \\nJune 24, 2014. The Master Fund commenced operations\\n on July 2, 2014.  \\n The investment objective of the Master Fund is to p\\nrovide consistent long-\\nterm appreciation of assets \\nthrough implementation of a systematic trading mode\\nl or portfolio of systematic trading models that \\ntrade in a number of debt, equity, foreign exchange\\n and commodity instruments, and derivative \\ncontracts relating to those instruments including s\\nwaps, indices, forwards, futures and option contrac\\nts. \\n A special purpose vehicle, Systematica Alternative \\nMarkets Investment Vehicle LLC (the ﬁSubsidiaryﬂ) \\nwas registered in the state of Delaware on June 10,\\n 2014. The \\npurpose of the Subsidiary was to provide \\nthe Master Fund with a practicable means of access \\nto certain instruments traded in Brazil. As the \\nMaster Fund owned 100% of the Subsidiary, the resul\\nts of operations of the Subsidiary up to the date o\\nf \\nliquidation \\nhave been consolidated within these consolidated fi\\nnancial statements, with transactions \\nbetween the Master Fund and the Subsidiary eliminat\\ned upon consolidation. As of November 12, 2019, \\nthe Subsidiary was liquidated. \\n The Master Fund has appointed the \\nInvestment Manager as the investment manager. The I\\nnvestment \\nManager is registered as an investment adviser with\\n the United States Securities and Exchange \\nCommission (ﬁSECﬂ) under the United States Investme\\nnt Advisers Act of 1940 and is licensed and \\nregula\\nted by the Jersey Financial Service Commission (ﬁJF\\nSCﬂ). The Investment Manager is also \\nregistered as a CPO under the United States Commodi\\nty Exchange Act and is a member of the National \\nFutures Association (ﬁNFAﬂ). The Investment Manager\\n is the Alternativ\\ne Investment Fund Manager \\n(ﬁAIFMﬂ) of the Master Fund, for the purpose of the\\n AIFM Directive 2011/61/EU of the European \\nParliament and the Council of the European Union on\\n alternative investment fund managers and any \\napplicable implementing legislation, re\\ngulations or rules thereunder in each case as may b\\ne altered, \\namended, added to or cancelled from time to time (t\\nhe \"AIFM Directive\"). \\n The Investment Manager has appointed three Sub-\\nInvestment Managers, Systematica Investments GP \\nLimited (ﬁSIGPLﬂ), actin\\ng in its capacity as general partner of Systematica\\n Investments Guernsey LP, \\nand acting through its Geneva branch (the ﬁGeneva B\\nranchﬂ); Systematica Investments Singapore Pte. \\nLimited (\"SISPL\") and Systematica Investments UK LL\\nP (\"SI UK LLP\") (together wit\\nh SIGPL & \\nSISPL the \"Sub-\\nInvestment Managers\") to undertake the investment m\\nanagement activities on behalf of \\nthe Master Fund.

SS&C Fund Services (Cayman) Limited (the \\nﬁAdministratorﬂ) acts as the Master Fund™s administ\\nrator. \\n The \\nMaster Fund\\'s investors consist exclusively of two \\ninvestment vehicles: Systematica Alternative \\nMarkets Fund Limited and Systematica Alternative Ma\\nrkets Fund L.P. (collectively the ﬁFeedersﬂ). The \\nFeeders invest substantially all of their investabl\\ne assets \\nin the Master Fund and are subject to an \\ninvestment management agreement with the Investment\\n Manager. Accordingly, the Master Fund does \\nnot pay management and performance fees to the Inve\\nstment Manager. \\n As of December 31, 2020, Systematica Alternative \\nMarkets Fund Limited held 433,970.84 Euro Shares, \\n9,371,782.63 US$ Shares, 261,855.32 Sterling Shares\\n, 6,557.16 CHF Shares of the Master Fund, \\nrepresenting an ownership interest of approximately\\n 71.88%.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \\n\\n Basis of Presentation \\n\\n The Financial Accounting Standards Board (ﬁFASBﬂ) A\\nccounting Standards Codification (ﬁASCﬂ) \\nis \\nthe exclusive reference of authoritative U.S. Gener\\nally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"U.S. GAAP\") \\nrecognized by the FASB to be applied by non-\\ngovernmental entities. The Master Fund meets the \\ndefinition of an investment company and follows the\\n accoun\\nting and reporting guidance in ASC 946. \\nThe following is a summary of the significant accou\\nnting and reporting policies used in preparing the \\nconsolidated financial statements. \\n Redemptions Payable \\n\\n Redemptions are recognised as liabilities when the \\namount requested in the redemption notices becomes \\nfixed, which generally occurs on the last day of th\\ne month. As a result, the redemptions paid after th\\ne \\nend of the year, based on the NAV of the Master Fun\\nd at year-end, are included in redemptions payable\\n at December 31, 2020\\n. Redemption notices received for which the dollar \\namount is not fixed remain in \\nnet assets until the net asset values used to deter\\nmine the redemption and share amounts are determine\\nd.\\n   \\n«FundLegalName_Titles» \\n«SectionTitle_Notes» (continued) \\n  «Footnote2»\\n 14 \\n  New Accounting Pronouncements \\n\\n Going Concern \\n\\n As per the FASB™s Accounting Standards Update No. 2\\n014-15 Presentation of Financial Statements Œ\\n Going Concern (Subtopic 205-\\n40) Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity™s A\\nbility to Continue as a \\nGoing Concern (ﬁASU 2014-15ﬂ), management has made \\nan assessment of the Master Fund\\'s ability to \\ncontinue as a going concern and is satisfied that t\\nhe Master Fund has resources to continue in busines\\ns \\nfor the foreseeable future. Furthermore, management\\n is not aware of any material uncertainties that ma\\ny \\nca\\nst significant doubt upon the Master Fund\\'s ability\\n to continue as a going concern, therefore the \\nfinancial statements continue to be prepared on a g\\noing concern basis. \\n Valuation of Investments \\n\\n Investments in securities and derivative contracts \\nare \\nvalued at fair value as discussed in Note 3. The \\nDirectors may, at their discretion, permit another \\nmethod of valuation to be used if they consider tha\\nt \\nsuch method of valuation better reflects fair value\\n and is in accordance with U.S. GAAP. \\n The fair val\\nue of the Master Fund\\'s assets and liabilities that\\n qualify as financial instruments \\napproximates the carrying amounts presented in the \\nConsolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities. \\n Revenue and Expenses \\n\\n Investment transactions are accounted for on \\na trade date basis. Realized gains or losses on inv\\nestments \\nare recorded on a specific identification basis in \\nthe Consolidated Statement of Operations. Interest \\nincome and expense are accrued as earned or incurre\\nd and include amortization of premiums and \\ndiscounts. The Master Fund amortizes premiums and a\\nccretes discounts on debt securities using the \\neffective yield method. \\n Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign curre\\nncies are translated into United States dollars at \\nthe \\nclosing rates of exchange \\nat the date of determination. Transactions during t\\nhe year are translated at the \\nrate of exchange prevailing on the date of the tran\\nsaction. The Master Fund does not isolate that port\\nion \\nof gains or losses on investments resulting from ch\\nanges in foreign e\\nxchange rates on investments from \\nthe fluctuations arising from changes in market pri\\nces of investments held. Such fluctuations are \\nincluded in net realized gain/(loss) on investments\\n and net change in unrealized \\nappreciation/(depreciation) on investments in the C\\nonsolidated Statement of Operations. \\n Realized gains or losses on foreign currency relate\\nd or denominated transactions arise from sales of \\nforeign currencies, currency gains or losses realiz\\ned between the trade and settlement dates on \\ninvestment t\\nransactions and the difference between investment i\\nncome and expenses recorded on the \\nMaster Fund\\'s books and the United States dollar eq\\nuivalent of the amounts actually received or paid. \\nNet unrealized appreciation or depreciation on fore\\nign currency rela\\nted or denominated transactions \\narise from changes in the carrying values of assets\\n and liabilities, other than investments in securit\\nies \\nand derivative contracts, during the period, result\\ning from changes in exchange rates. \\n  \\n«FundLegalName_Titles» \\n«SectionTitle_Notes» (continued) \\n  «Footnote2»\\n 15 \\n  Cash and Cash Equivalents \\n\\n Cash consists of cash held at banks. The Master Fun\\nd considers cash equivalents to generally include \\nshort-\\nterm, highly liquid investments with original matur\\nities of three months or less at the time of \\npurchase and money market funds which invest in sho\\nrt-\\nterm, highly liquid investments with weighted \\naverage maturities of three months or less. Cash eq\\nuivalents, which generally consist of money market \\nfunds, are valued at net asset value per share. Amo\\nunts included in restricted cash represent those \\nrequir\\ned to be set aside by a contractual agreement with \\na counterparty for the purpose of a collateral or \\nfuture contracts margin. As of December 31, 2020, c\\nash equivalents include investments in money \\nmarket funds as follows: \\n Investments in Money Market Funds Currency\\n Shares \\n  Fair Value \\n Percentage\\n of Net \\nAssets\\n Europe \\n      Institutional Cash Series Plc - Institutional Euro \\nLiquidity Fund Euro 5,231 \\n $ 584,465 \\n 0.02%\\n  Institutional Cash Series Plc - Institutional Sterl\\ning Liquidity \\nFund \\nSterling 1,105,000 \\n   \\n1,463,020 \\n 0.05%\\n  Institutional Cash Series Plc - Institutional US Do\\nllar Liquidity \\nFund \\nUS$ 307,898,000 \\n   \\n307,898,000 \\n 10.38%\\n  JPMorgan Liquidity Funds - Sterling Liquidity Fund \\nSterling 1,006,704 \\n   \\n1,332,877 \\n 0.04%\\n  JPMorgan Liquidity Funds - U.S. Dollar Liquidity Fu\\nnd US$ 307,976,393 \\n   \\n307,976,393 \\n 10.39%\\n Total investments in money market funds  \\n $ 619,254,755 \\n 20.88%\\n  Income Taxes \\n\\nUnder current Cayman Islands law, the Master Fund i\\ns not subject to income or capital \\ngains tax in that \\njurisdiction for a period of 20 years from the date\\n of an undertaking from the Governor-in-\\nCabinet of \\nthe Cayman Islands. \\nThe Master Fund has elected to be treated as a part\\nnership for United States Federal income tax \\npurposes. No Federa\\nl, state or local taxes have been provided on the i\\nncome and losses of the Master \\nFund since the shareholders are individually liable\\n for reporting their share of the Master Fund\\'s inc\\nome \\nand losses. \\n\\nThe Investment Manager periodically evaluates tax p\\nosit\\nions that the Master Fund has taken, expects to \\ntake or that are otherwise relevant to the Master F\\nund for the purposes of determining whether any \\nrelevant tax positions would ﬁmore-likely-than-\\nnotﬂ be sustained upon examination by the applicabl\\ne \\ntax autho\\nrity. The Investment Manager has analyzed such tax \\npositions and has concluded that no \\nunrecognized tax benefits should be recorded for th\\ne current year. As of December 31, 2020, the tax \\nyears that remain subject to examination by the rel\\nevant tax jurisdic\\ntions under the statute of limitations \\nare from the year 2014 forward. Currently, the only\\n taxes recorded, if any, by the Master Fund on its \\nincome are withholding taxes applicable to certain \\nincome. For the year ended December 31, 2020, no \\nincome tax liab\\nility or expense has been recorded in the accompany\\ning consolidated financial \\nstatements. Tax penalties and interest, if any, wou\\nld be accrued as incurred and would be classified a\\ns \\ntax expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operat\\nions. \\n  \\n«FundLegalName_Titles» \\n«SectionTitle_Notes» (continued) \\n  «Footnote2»\\n 16 \\n Use of Estimates \\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordan\\nce with U.S. GAAP requires management to make \\nestimates and assumptions that affect the amounts r\\neported in the consolidated financial statements an\\nd \\naccompanying notes. Actual results could differ fro\\nm these estimates. The Master Fund has not used \\nany estimates in the preparation of these financial\\n statements. \\n Principles of Consolidation \\n\\nThe Master Fund consolidates wholly owned investmen\\nt companies that it manages and controls.\\n  3. Fair Value Measurements of Investments \\n\\n The Master Fund discloses information about financi\\nal instruments that are measured and reported at \\nfair value within a framework for measuring fair va\\nlue which includes a hierarchy based on the quality\\n \\nof inputs used to measu\\nre fair value. Fair value is the price that would b\\ne received to sell an asset or \\npaid to transfer a liability (ﬁexitﬂ price). \\n The hierarchical disclosure framework discussed bel\\now prioritizes and categorizes the level of market \\nprice observability used \\nin measuring financial instruments at fair value. M\\narket price observability is \\naffected by a number of factors, including the type\\n of financial instrument and the characteristics \\nspecific to the financial instrument. \\n Observable inputs are inputs that re\\nflect the assumptions market participants would use\\n in pricing the \\nfinancial instrument developed based on market data\\n obtained from sources independent of the \\nreporting entity. Financial instruments with readil\\ny available active quoted prices or for which \\nfair value \\ncan be measured from actively quoted prices will ha\\nve a higher degree of market price observability an\\nd \\na lesser degree of judgment used in measuring fair \\nvalue. The hierarchical disclosure framework \\ndescribes a three-level hierarchy which give\\ns the highest priority to quoted prices in active m\\narkets for \\nidentical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the l\\nowest priority to significant unobservable inputs (\\nLevel \\n3). If the inputs used to value the investments fal\\nl within different levels of the hi\\nerarchy, the \\ncategorization is based on the lower level input th\\nat is significant to the fair value measurement of \\nthe \\ninvestments. \\n The inputs are summarized in the three-level hierar\\nchy as follows: \\n Level 1 Œ\\n Valuation is based on unadjusted quoted pri\\nces in active markets that are accessible at the \\nmeasurement date for identical, unrestricted invest\\nments. \\n Level 2 Œ\\n Valuation is based on other significant observable \\ninputs, either directly or indirectly, at the \\nmeasurement date such as a) quoted \\nprices for similar assets or liabilities in active \\nmarkets; \\nb) quoted prices for identical or similar assets an\\nd liabilities in markets that are not active; c) \\nobservable inputs, other than quoted prices, for as\\nsets and liabilities; or d) inputs that are \\nderived from or corroborated by observable market d\\nata by correlation or other means. \\n«FundLegalName_Titles» \\n«SectionTitle_Notes» (continued) \\n  «Footnote2»\\n 17 \\n  Level 3 Œ\\n Valuation is based on significant unobservable inpu\\nts for an asset or liability. Unobservable \\ninputs are used to measure fair value to the extent\\n that observab\\nle inputs are not available, \\nthereby allowing for situations in which there is l\\nittle, if any, market activity for the asset or \\nliability at the measurement date. However, the fai\\nr value measurement objective remains \\nthe same, that is, an exit price from the perspecti\\nve of a market participant that holds the \\nasset or owes the liability. Therefore, unobservabl\\ne inputs reflect the Master Fund\\'s own \\nassumptions about the assumptions that market parti\\ncipants would use in pricing the asset or \\nliability, includin\\ng assumptions about risk. Unobservable inputs are d\\neveloped based on the \\nbest information available in the circumstances, wh\\nich might include the Master Fund\\'s own \\ndata. The Master Fund™s own data used to develop un\\nobservable inputs is adjusted if \\ninformat\\nion is reasonably available without undue cost and \\neffort that indicates the market \\nparticipants would use different assumptions. \\n The inputs or methodology used for valuing investme\\nnts are not necessarily an indication of the risk \\nassociated with investing in those investments. \\n \\n  \\n«FundLegalName_Titles» \\n«SectionTitle_Notes» (continued) \\n  «Footnote2»\\n 18 \\n 3.

If no such sales occur\\nred on the respective valuation date, \\nthey are valued at the mean of the closing bid and \\noffer prices, or at the official exchange closing p\\nrice. \\nA description of the valuation techniques applied t\\no the M\\naster Fund\\'s classes of investments in \\nsecurities which are listed or quoted on a securiti\\nes exchange or other regulated market measured at f\\nair \\nvalue is as follows: \\n\\nŁ United States Treasury securities Œ United States T\\nreasury securities are valued using \\nunadjusted \\nquoted market prices. Accordingly, United States Tr\\neasury securities are generally categorized in \\nLevel 1 of the fair value hierarchy.  \\nInvestments in securities, which are not listed or \\nquoted on a securities exchange or other regulated \\nmarket\\n, or if, being so listed or quoted, are not regular\\nly traded thereon or in respect of which no prices \\nas described above are available, are valued at fai\\nr value giving regard to valuations provided by \\nindependent brokers and valuation agents or pricing\\n mod\\nels that consider the time value of money and \\nthe current market and contractual prices and poten\\ntial volatilities of the underlying enterprise, the\\n cost \\nprice, the price at which any recent transaction in\\n the security may have been effected, the liquidity\\n of \\nthe position, comparison to other quoted enterprise\\ns on a market multiple basis, and any other factors\\n as \\nthe Directors deem relevant. A description of the v\\naluation techniques and inputs applied to the Maste\\nr \\nFund™s classes of investments in securitie\\ns which are not listed or quoted on a securities ex\\nchange or \\nother regulated market measured at fair value is as\\n follows: \\nŁ Government bonds (excluding United States Treasury \\nsecurities) Œ \\nGovernment bonds are primarily \\nvalued using estimated market price \\nquotations (where observable) or recently executed \\nmarket \\ntransactions. G8 Government bonds are generally cat\\negorized in Level 1 and other Government bonds \\nin Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy; in instance\\ns where prices, spreads or any key inputs are \\nun\\nobservable, they are categorized in Level 3. The ke\\ny inputs for government bonds valuation are \\ncoupon frequency, coupon rate and underlying bond s\\npread. \\nDerivative Contracts \\n\\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Master Fund\\n enters into various types of \\nderivative contracts \\nwhich serve as components of the Master Fund\\'s inve\\nstment strategies and are utilized primarily to \\nstructure and hedge investments to enhance performa\\nnce and reduce risk to the Master Fund. \\nDerivative contracts which are dealt in or \\ntraded through a clearing firm or exchange (ﬁExchan\\nge \\nTraded Derivative Contractsﬂ) are valued at the mos\\nt recent settlement price quoted by that clearing \\nfirm or exchange. If there is no such price, then t\\nhese investments are valued at the mean between th\\ne \\noffer price and the bid price at the close of busin\\ness on any market on which such investments are or \\ncan be dealt in or traded. A description of the val\\nuation techniques and investment objectives as they\\n \\nrelate to each class of the Master Fund\\'s Exchang\\ne Traded Derivative Contracts measured at fair valu\\ne \\nis as follows: \\n«FundLegalName_Titles» \\n«SectionTitle_Notes» (continued) \\n  «Footnote2»\\n 23 \\n Ł Exchange Traded Derivative Contracts Œ \\nExchange traded derivative contracts generally incl\\nude \\nexchange traded futures contracts. The Master Fund \\nmay use such contracts to gain exposure \\nto, or \\nhedge against, changes in the value of equities, bo\\nnds, interest rates or commodities. Exchange traded\\n \\nderivative contracts that are traded actively are v\\nalued based on unadjusted quoted prices from the \\nrelevant exchange and are categorized in Level \\n1 of the fair value hierarchy. Listed derivative \\ncontracts that are not traded actively are valued u\\nsing similar fundamental approaches as those \\napplied to OTC derivative contracts and are general\\nly categorized in Level 2. \\nDerivative contracts which are \\nnot dealt in or traded through a clearing firm or e\\nxchange are considered \\nOTC derivative contracts. OTC derivative contracts \\nare valued at fair value giving regard to the cost \\nprice, the latest available valuation provided by t\\nhe relevant counterparty or o\\nther independent brokers \\nor valuation service providers and pricing models t\\nhat consider the time value of money, the current \\nmarket and contractual prices and potential volatil\\nities of the underlying financial instruments. \\nŁ OTC Derivative Contracts Œ \\nOTC derivative contracts include forward and swap c\\nontracts related to \\nforeign exchange, interest rates, equity and credit\\n. Depending on the specific terms of the transactio\\nn \\nand the nature of the product, the fair value of OT\\nC d\\nerivative contracts can either be observed or \\nmodeled using a series of techniques and model inpu\\nts from comparable benchmarks including \\nclosed-\\nform analytic formulas and simulation models or a c\\nombination thereof. Many pricing models \\ndo not require a larg\\ne degree of subjectivity because the methodologies \\nemployed do not generally \\nnecessitate significant judgment. The pricing input\\ns are primarily observed from actively quoted \\nmarkets, which is the case for forward and swap con\\ntracts. The majority of the OTC \\nderivative \\ncontracts held by the Master Fund are valued using \\ninternal market standard pricing models which \\nsources relevant market data from various market ma\\nkers or dealers which are generally verified by \\nthe Administrator. To the extent that the deriva\\ntive contracts can be valued by this standard prici\\nng \\nmodel using observable market data, OTC derivatives\\n are categorized in Level 2 of the fair value \\nhierarchy; otherwise, they are categorized in Level\\n 3. A description of the valuation techniques, inpu\\nts \\nand investment objectives as they relate to each cl\\nass of the Master Fund\\'s OTC derivative contracts \\nmeasured at fair value is as follows: \\n  Forward Contracts Œ Forward contracts are generally\\n non-\\nstandardized derivative contracts \\nbetween two parties to \\nbuy or sell a currency or other underlying at a spe\\ncified future time at an \\nagreed upon price. The Master Fund enters into forw\\nard contracts for investment purposes as well \\nas to hedge against foreign currency exchange rate \\nand interest rate risk. These co\\nntracts are valued \\ndaily and the Master Fund\\'s net equity therein repr\\nesents unrealized appreciation or depreciation on \\nthe contracts as measured by the difference between\\n the contracted price or rate and the forward \\nprice or rate at the reporting date. Ge\\nnerally, the key inputs for most forward contracts \\ninclude \\nnotional, maturity, forward rate, spot rate, intere\\nst rate curves and discount factor. \\n«FundLegalName_Titles» \\n«SectionTitle_Notes» (continued) \\n  «Footnote2»\\n 24 \\n   Swap Contracts Œ \\nSwap contracts are agreements that obligate two par\\nties to exchange a series of \\ncash \\nflows at specified intervals based upon or calculat\\ned by reference to changes in a specified \\ncredit rating, rate, price, correlation, volatility\\n or dividend yield. The payment flows are generally\\n \\ncalculated off a notional amount and payments are u\\nsually ne\\ntted against each other, with the \\ndifference being paid by one party to the other. Th\\nerefore, amounts required for the future \\nsatisfaction of the swaps may be greater or less th\\nan the amount recorded. The majority of swaps \\nare valued using third party valu\\nation services, other externally verified pricing s\\nources or \\nquotations provided by the relevant counterparty or\\n other independent brokers. The key inputs for \\nswap valuation will vary based on the type of under\\nlying on which the contract was written. \\nGener\\nally, the key inputs for most swap contracts includ\\ne notional, swap period, fixed rate, credit \\nor interest rate curves, current market or spot pri\\nce of the underlying and the volatility of the \\nunderlying. \\n  Contracts for Differences Œ Contracts for diffe\\nrences are arrangements made in a forward contract \\nwhereby differences in settlement are made through \\ncash payments, rather than the delivery of \\nphysical goods or securities. The forward contract \\npayments will be linked to the performance and \\ncash flows of \\nan underlying equity. Accounting associated with co\\nntracts for differences is the \\nsame as forward contracts. Generally, the key input\\n for most contracts for differences is market \\nprice of the underlying security. \\n  Credit Default Swaps Œ In a credit def\\nault swap, the protection buyer makes a stream of p\\nayments \\nbased on a fixed percentage applied to the contract\\n notional amount to the protection seller in \\nexchange for the right to receive a specified retur\\nn upon the occurrence of a defined credit event on\\n the reference obligation that may be either a singl\\ne security or a basket of securities issued by \\ncorporate or sovereign issuers. Certain OTC contrac\\nts require the protection seller or buyer to make \\nan initial payment to the counterparty upon enterin\\ng int\\no the swap. Although contract specific, \\ncredit events are generally defined as bankruptcy, \\nfailure to pay, restructuring, obligation \\nacceleration, obligation default, or repudiation or\\n moratorium. Upon the occurrence of a defined \\ncredit event, the buyer of the swap may elect eithe\\nr to be paid in cash an amount equal to, \\ngenerally, the notional value of the contract less \\nthe current fair value of the underlying instrument\\n \\nas determined by a facilitated auction, or to deliv\\ner the underlying instrument to the \\nseller of the \\nswap in exchange for cash equal to the notional val\\nue of the instrument. Periodic payments \\nreceived (as a seller) or paid (as a buyer) on OTC \\nswap agreements, and cash payments received or \\nmade in excess of the fair value of the underlying \\nob\\nligation in the event of a credit event, are \\nrecorded as part of ﬁRealized gain (loss) on invest\\nmentsﬂ in the Consolidated Statement of \\nOperations. \\n  Option Contracts Œ an option is a contract which gi\\nves the buyer \\nthe right, but not the obligation, to \\nbuy or sell an underlying asset or instrument at a \\nspecified strike price \\nprior to or on a \\nspecified \\ndate, depending on the form of the option. The key \\ninputs for option valuation will vary \\nbased on the type of underlying on which the contra\\nct was written. \\nGenerally the key inputs for \\nmost option contracts include the current market or\\n spot price of the underlying, the strike price of \\nthe contract, the cost of holding a position in the\\n underlying security (including interest and \\ndividends), time to expiry to\\ngether with any restrictions that may occur and the\\n volatility of the \\nunderlying. \\n«FundLegalName_Titles» \\n«SectionTitle_Notes» (continued) \\n  «Footnote2»\\n 25 \\n Generally, when a derivative contract is closed, th\\ne Master Fund records a realized gain/(loss) equal \\nto \\nthe difference between the value of the contract at\\n the time it was \\nopened and the time it was closed. \\nThe Master Fund bears the market risk that arises f\\nrom changes in the value of these financial \\ninstruments.

The Maste\\nr Fund has \\nsubstantially all of its counterparty credit risk r\\nelated to the transactions described above with the\\n Prime \\nBrokers, Clearing Brokers and Custodians. \\n The Master Fund posted approximately $13\\n5.36 million of cash collateral for open derivative\\n contracts \\nand received approximately $134.55 million of cash \\ncollateral for open derivative contracts as of \\nDecember 31, 2020. These amounts are included in re\\nstricted cash, due from brokers and due to \\nbr\\nokers, respectively in the Consolidated Statement o\\nf Assets and Liabilities. In addition, the Master \\nFund pledged investments in bonds, at fair value, o\\nf approximately $299.94 million as collateral for \\nopen derivative contracts, which is held in segrega\\nted \\naccounts at investment grade banks and are \\nincluded in investments in securities, at fair valu\\ne on the Consolidated Statement of Assets and \\nLiabilities. A sub-\\nset of these figures which represents only the port\\nion of collateral posted/received by \\nthe Master Fund related to OTC derivative contracts\\n is presented in Note 5. \\n In the ordinary course of business of trading in se\\ncurities, the Master Fund posts and receives cash \\nrelated to settlements and other investment transac\\ntions with the Master Fund™s Prime \\nBrokers. As of \\nDecember 31, 2020, the Master Fund posted approxima\\ntely $37.98 million of cash related to these \\nrequirements which is included in due from brokers.\\n Additionally, the Master Fund may borrow funds \\non margin. Margin interest is paid at the dai\\nly financing rate. There were no margin debt balanc\\nes as of \\nDecember 31, 2020. \\n 5. Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Ris\\nk and Concentrations of Credit Risk \\n In the normal course of business, the Master Fund t\\nrades various financial instruments \\nand enters into \\nvarious investment activities with off-\\nbalance sheet risk. These financial instruments inc\\nlude OTC and \\nexchange traded derivative contracts. Generally, th\\nese financial instruments represent future \\ncommitments to purchase or sell other fina\\nncial instruments at specific terms at specific fut\\nure dates. \\nEach of these financial instruments contain varying\\n degrees of off-\\nbalance sheet risk whereby changes \\nin the fair values of the underlyings of the financ\\nial instruments or the Master Fund\\'s sati\\nsfaction of the \\nobligations may exceed the amount recognized in the\\n Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities. \\n The Master Fund\\'s principal trading activities are \\nprimarily with brokers and other financial institut\\nions \\nlocated in North America and \\nEurope. The Master Fund reduces its credit risk exp\\nosure to these brokers \\nby employing a number of strategies based on the ty\\npe of financial instrument. Where possible, fully \\nfunded securities are held in custody accounts at i\\nnvestment grade banks. For OTC \\nderivative contracts, \\nthe Master Fund negotiates with its counterparties \\nto obtain segregation of initial margin pledged as \\npart \\nof the transaction. As of December 31, 2020, the Ma\\nster Fund™s exposure on the above transactions was \\nconcentrated with 2 major securities firms. \\n«FundLegalName_Titles» \\n«SectionTitle_Notes» (continued) \\n  «Footnote2»\\n 27 \\n  The notional contract amounts of OTC derivative con\\ntracts do not represent the Master Fund\\'s risk of \\nloss due to counterparty non-\\nperformance. The Master Fund\\'s exposure to credit r\\nisk associated with \\ncounterparty non-performance for \\nthese contracts is limited to the gross fair value \\nof the OTC derivative \\ncontracts in an asset position in excess of the gro\\nss fair value of those contracts in a liability pos\\nition, \\nnet of any collateral, permitted to be set off unde\\nr master netting arrangements. \\n As discussed in Note 4, the Master Fund obtains/pro\\nvides collateral from/to various counterparties for\\n \\nOTC derivative contracts in accordance with bilater\\nal collateral agreements. The Master Fund holds \\ncash collateral of approximately $103.42 mil\\nlion from certain counterparties as of December 31,\\n 2020. \\nThe Master Fund posted collateral in the form of ca\\nsh approximately $131.21 million and investments \\nin bonds, at fair value of approximately $299.94 mi\\nllion, to certain counterparties to cover colla\\nteral \\nrequirements for open OTC derivative contracts. The\\nse amounts are a sub-\\nset of total amounts disclosed \\nin Note 4. \\n Several of the Master Fund\\'s OTC derivative master \\nnetting agreements contain provisions (ﬁcredit-\\nrisk \\nrelated contingent featuresﬂ) t\\nhat require the Master Fund to maintain a certain l\\nevel of net assets or \\nlimit the size of certain liability positions. If t\\nhe Master Fund\\'s net assets or size of certain liab\\nility \\npositions were to fall below or above the provision\\ns within the master nett\\ning agreements, the Master \\nFund would be in violation of those provisions and \\nthe counterparties to the OTC derivative contracts \\ncould request immediate payment or demand immediate\\n and ongoing full overnight collateralization on \\nOTC derivative contracts in \\nnet liability positions. The aggregate fair value o\\nf all OTC derivative \\ncontracts with credit-risk-\\nrelated contingent features that are in a net liabi\\nlity position as of December \\n31, 2020 is approximately $44.47 million for which \\nthe Master Fund has poste\\nd securities collateral of \\napproximately $211.03 million and cash collateral o\\nf approximately $51.42 million in the normal course\\n \\nof business. If the credit risk-\\nrelated contingent features underlying these instru\\nments had been \\ntriggered as of December 31, \\n2020 and the Master Fund had to settle these instru\\nments immediately, the \\nMaster Fund would not be required to make any payme\\nnt to the counterparties. \\n \\n6. Guarantees \\n\\n In the normal course of business, the Master Fund t\\nrades and holds certain fair-valued \\nderivative \\ncontracts which constitute guarantees under U.S. GA\\nAP. \\n The maximum payout for written call option contract\\ns is limitless and contingent upon the market price\\n \\nof the underlying at the date of a payout event; th\\ne maximum payout for written put \\noption contracts is \\nlimited to the number of contracts written. Written\\n currency option contracts obligate the Master Fund\\n \\nto physically settle each contract through the purc\\nhase of foreign currencies at specified exchange ra\\ntes \\nif the put options are exercised by the counterpart\\nies. As of December 31, 2020\\n, the Master Fund had a \\nmaximum undiscounted payout amount of approximately\\n $6.27 billion relating to written currency \\noption contracts, which expire between January 2020\\n and December 2020. The fair val\\nue of these \\nwritten option contracts, as of December 31, 2020\\n, is approximately $64.4 million. The Master Fund\\'s\\n \\nmaximum undiscounted payout amount is reduced to ap\\nproximately $1.05 billion after taking into \\nconsideration offsetting purchased option \\ncontracts held on the same underlying currencies wi\\nth similar \\nmaturities. Additionally, the maximum payout amount\\n could be offset by the subsequent sale of \\ncurrencies obtained via the execution of a payout e\\nvent. \\n«FundLegalName_Titles» \\n«SectionTitle_Notes» (continued) \\n  «Footnote2»\\n 28 \\n  The Master Fund enters into credit deriva\\ntive contracts, principally through credit default \\nswaps, under \\nwhich it provides counterparties protection against\\n the risk of default on a set of debt obligations i\\nssued \\nby a specific reference entity or entities. The sel\\nler of the credit derivative cont\\nract is entitled to receive \\nperiodic payments from the buyer during the term of\\n the swap contract and in the event of default of a\\n \\nspecified security, the seller is obligated to eith\\ner purchase the defaulted security at par or to mak\\ne a \\npayment to the buye\\nr equal to the notional amount of the swap contract\\n less the recovery value of the \\ndefaulted security. Credit spreads serve as an indi\\ncator or the payment/performance risk and also the \\nlikelihood of risk of default for the credit deriva\\ntive. Wider credit s\\npreads represent a deterioration of \\nthe referenced entity™s credit worthiness and a gre\\nater likelihood of the risk of default or other cre\\ndit \\nevents occurring as defined under the terms of the \\nagreement. \\n «FundLegalName_Titles» \\n«SectionTitle_Notes» (continued) \\n  «Footnote2»\\n 29 \\n The table below summarizes certain information rega\\nrding protection sold through credit default swaps \\nas of December 31, 2020:\\n  XXX \\nProtection Sold \\nMaximum Potential Payout/Notional \\nYears to Maturity  \\nCredit spreads (in basis points) on the\\n underlying as of December 31, 2020 Less than 1 \\n 1 - 3 \\n 3 - 5 \\n Above 5 \\n Total \\n Net Fair Value* \\n Index credit default swaps: \\n  \\n0 - 250 \\n- \\n - \\n (7,944,082,700)\\n - \\n (7,944,082,700)\\n 285,128,621 \\n 251 - 500 \\n- \\n - \\n (1,050,390,000)\\n - \\n (1,050,390,000)\\n 102,684,408 \\n Total index credit default swaps \\n $                                - \\n  $                                - \\n  $        (8,994,472,700) \\n  $                                - \\n  $        (8,994,472,700) \\n  $             387,813,029 \\n   \\n          Total credit default swaps sold \\n $                                - \\n  $                                - \\n  $        (8,994,472,700) \\n  $                                - \\n  $        (8,994,472,700) \\n  $             387,813,029 \\n        *  Fair value amounts are shown exclusive of cash c\\nollateral. \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n «FundLegalName_Titles» \\n«SectionTitle_Notes» (continued) \\n  «Footnote2»\\n 30 \\n For credit default swaps, the Master Fund has sold \\nprotection with a notional amount of approximately \\n$8.99 billion.
